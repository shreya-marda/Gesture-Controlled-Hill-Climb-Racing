# Gesture-Controlled Hill Climb Racer

The Hill Climb Racer Using Hands project aims to provide an interactive gaming experience where players can control a virtual vehicle on a challenging terrain using their hand gestures. The game employs computer vision algorithms to recognize specific hand movements and translate them into actions within the game.

This repository contains the code and resources for a hill climb racing game that can be controlled using hand gestures. The game utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and interpret hand movements, allowing the player to control the in-game vehicle by moving their hands in different directions.

This project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

Python: The primary programming language for the project.

OpenCV: Used for image processing and hand detection.

PyAutoGui: An automation library that allows mouse and keyboard control

MediaPipe: A framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines, used here for hand tracking.
